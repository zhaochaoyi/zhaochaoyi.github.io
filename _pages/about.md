Hi! I am a Postdoctoral Associate at [MIT Sloan School of Management](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/) and the [MIT Laboratory for Financial Engineering](https://lfe.mit.edu), under the supervision of Professor [Andrew W. Lo](https://alo.mit.edu/). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Statistics from [Peking University School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/) in January 2024, advised by Professor [Lan Wu](http://english.math.pku.edu.cn//Faculty/Facuity/ALL/old_site_Faculty_ALL_2_14.htm) and Professor [Ruixun Zhang](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/ZhangRuixun/). I received my B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics and B.S. in Computer Science and Technology (double degree) from Peking University in 2019. I am a Fellow of the [Society of Actuaries](https://www.soa.org/) (FSA). 

My research interests include investments, high-dimensional statistics, machine learning applications in finance, healthcare finance, and actuarial sciences. My research has been recognized by the [S&P Global Academic ESG Research Award (2022)](https://www.pm-research.com/SPGlobal-ESGAward) and the [Best Paper Prize for Young Scholars in the Annual Conference of the Operations Research Society of China (Financial Engineering and Risk Management Branch, 2023)](https://www.stat-center.pku.edu.cn/en/Events/news_en/1365174.htm).
