Hi! I am a Postdoctoral Associate at [MIT Sloan School of Management](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/), under the supervision of Professor [Andrew W. Lo](https://alo.mit.edu/). I am also affiliated with the [MIT Laboratory for Financial Engineering](https://lfe.mit.edu). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Statistics from [Peking University School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/) in January 2024, advised by Professor [Lan Wu](http://english.math.pku.edu.cn/peoplefaculty/14.html) and Professor [Ruixun Zhang](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/ZhangRuixun%20/index.html). I received my B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics and B.S. in Computer Science and Technology (double degree) from Peking University in 2019. I was enrolled as an Associate of the [Society of Actuaries](https://www.soa.org/) in 2023. 

My research interests include investments, high-dimensional statistics, machine learning applications in finance, and actuarial sciences. My research has been recognized by the [S&P Global Academic ESG Research Award (2022)](https://www.pm-research.com/SPGlobal-ESGAward) and the [Best Paper Prize for Young Scholars in the Annual Conference of the Operations Research Society of China (Financial Engineering and Risk Management Branch, 2023)](https://www.stat-center.pku.edu.cn/en/Events/news_en/1365174.htm). 

My key research topics are:
- **Investments**
  + Factor investing
  + High-frequency investing/trading
  + Sustainable investing
- **Statistics**
  + High-dimensional statistics
  + Machine learning & deep learning
- **Actuarial Sciences**
  + Copula theory

Here is my latest [CV](./CV/CYZhao_CV.pdf).

I am very happy to work with motivated students. **<font color="#AC2C1D">Don't hesitate to drop me an email if you are interested in cooperating with me!</font>** 😆

- **2024.07: 🎉 I am honored to receive the** ***<font color="#AC2C1D">[Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award of Peking University](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/DlP8SeWEUOa5ZimUm01oIA)</font>*****!**
- **2024.04: The preprint of our working paper "The Checkerboard Copula and Dependence Concepts" is now on arXiv.** 
  + This paper can be found here: [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15023)]. Critical comments are very much appreciated.
  + We study the problem of choosing the copula when the marginal distributions of a random vector are not all continuous. We show that the checkerboard copula (the unique copula with a distribution that is as uniform as possible within regions of flexibility) has the largest Shannon entropy, which means that it carries the least information among all possible copulas for a given random vector. Furthermore, the checkerboard copula preserves the dependence information of the original random vector, leading to two applications in the context of diversification penalty and impact portfolios.

  + We characterize the distribution of induced order statistics for general dependence and general marginals of any bivariate random variables, which is used to construct optimal impact portfolios. 
  + I won second place in the [Best Paper Prize for Young Scholars at the Annual Conference of the Operations Research Society of China (Financial Engineering and Risk Management Branch)](https://www.stat-center.pku.edu.cn/en/Events/news_en/1365174.htm) in 2023.
