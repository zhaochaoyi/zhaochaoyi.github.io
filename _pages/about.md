Hi! I am a Postdoctoral Associate at [MIT Sloan School of Management](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/) and the [MIT Laboratory for Financial Engineering](https://lfe.mit.edu), under the supervision of Professor [Andrew W. Lo](https://alo.mit.edu/). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Statistics from [Peking University School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/) in January 2024, advised by Professor [Lan Wu](http://english.math.pku.edu.cn//Faculty/Facuity/ALL/old_site_Faculty_ALL_2_14.htm) and Professor [Ruixun Zhang](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/ZhangRuixun/). I received my B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics and B.S. in Computer Science and Technology (double degree) from Peking University in 2019. I am a Fellow of the [Society of Actuaries](https://www.soa.org/) (FSA). 

My research interests include investments, high-dimensional statistics, machine learning applications in finance, healthcare finance, and actuarial sciences. My research has been recognized by the [S&P Global Academic ESG Research Award (2022)](https://www.pm-research.com/SPGlobal-ESGAward) and the [Best Paper Prize for Young Scholars in the Annual Conference of the Operations Research Society of China (Financial Engineering and Risk Management Branch, 2023)](https://www.stat-center.pku.edu.cn/en/Events/news_en/1365174.htm). 

My key research topics are:
- **Investments**
  + Factor investing
  + High-frequency investing/trading
  + Sustainable investing
- **Statistics**
  + High-dimensional statistics
  + Machine learning & deep learning
- **Actuarial Sciences**
  + Copula theory

Here is my latest [CV](./CV/CYZhao_CV.pdf).

  + This paper can be found here: [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15023)]. Critical comments are very much appreciated.
  + We study the problem of choosing the copula when the marginal distributions of a random vector are not all continuous. We show that the checkerboard copula (the unique copula with a distribution that is as uniform as possible within regions of flexibility) has the largest Shannon entropy, which means that it carries the least information among all possible copulas for a given random vector. Furthermore, the checkerboard copula preserves the dependence information of the original random vector, leading to two applications in the context of diversification penalty and impact portfolios.
