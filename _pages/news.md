- **2025.01: 🎉 Our paper "High-Frequency Liquidity in the Chinese Stock Market: Measurements, Patterns, and Determinants" is accepted by** ***<font color="#AC2C1D">Pacific-Basin Finance Journal</font>*****!**
  + This paper can be found here: [[SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4191675)]. 
  + We study a range of high-frequency liquidity measures in the Chinese stock market using limit order book data. 

- **2024.09: 🎆 I am enrolled as a** [***<font color="#AC2C1D">Fellow of the Society of Actuaries (FSA)</font>***](https://www.actuarialdirectory.org/?searchType=11&discloseId=FJs51nnroDJm7QM1u25ojw%3D%3D)**!**
  
- **2024.07: 🎆 I am honored to receive the** [***<font color="#AC2C1D">Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award of Peking University</font>***](https://grs.pku.edu.cn/xwgz11/xwsy11/yblw111/381890.htm)**!**
  + This is reported by [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/DlP8SeWEUOa5ZimUm01oIA), Peking University.
    
- **2024.04: The preprint of our working paper "The Checkerboard Copula and Dependence Concepts" is now on arXiv.** 
  + This paper can be found here: [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15023)]. Critical comments are very much appreciated.
  + We study the problem of choosing the copula when the marginal distributions of a random vector are not all continuous. We show that the checkerboard copula (the unique copula with a distribution that is as uniform as possible within regions of flexibility) has the largest Shannon entropy, which means that it carries the least information among all possible copulas for a given random vector. Furthermore, the checkerboard copula preserves the dependence information of the original random vector, leading to two applications in the context of diversification penalty and impact portfolios.
- **2024.04: 🎆 I am enrolled as a Postdoctoral Associate at** ***<font color="#AC2C1D">MIT Sloan School of Management</font>*****. Welcome to visit Cambridge and MIT!**
- **2024.03: Our work has been reported by [Center for Statistical Science](https://www.stat-center.pku.edu.cn/xwdt/zxxw/1375261.htm), Peking University.**
- **2024.02: 🎉 Our paper "Optimal Impact Portfolios with General Dependence and Marginals" is accepted by** ***<font color="#AC2C1D">Operations Research</font>*****!**
  + This paper is currently published online: [[PDF](./publication/2024_OR_Induced_Order_Statistics.pdf)] [[Appendix](./publication/2024_OR_Induced_Order_Statistics_Appendix.pdf)] [[Journal](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2023.0400)].
  + We characterize the distribution of induced order statistics for general dependence and general marginals of any bivariate random variables, which is used to construct optimal impact portfolios. 
  + I won second place in the [Best Paper Prize for Young Scholars at the Annual Conference of the Operations Research Society of China (Financial Engineering and Risk Management Branch)](https://www.stat-center.pku.edu.cn/en/Events/news_en/1365174.htm) in 2023.
    
- **2024.01: I receive my Ph.D. degree in Statistics from Peking University! I am expected to be a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT Sloan School of Management in this year.**
  + I successfully early graduate for half a year.
  + It is my honor to be a [Beijing Outstanding Graduate](https://jw.beijing.gov.cn/tzgg/202401/t20240102_3522508.html) in Spring 2024.
    
- **2023.12: I successfully pass my Ph.D. thesis defense!**
  + The title of my Ph.D. thesis (in Chinese) is "Stochastic Models and Statistical Analysis for High-dimensional Multi-factor Models and Induced Order Statistics" (高维多因子模型与伴随次序统计量的随机模型与统计分析).
  + I am also happy to be the first student to defend my thesis in Zhihua Building, the new building of Peking University School of Mathematical Sciences.

- **2023.11: 🎉 Our paper "Construct Smith-Wilson Risk-Free Interest Rate Curves with Endogenous and Positive Ultimate Forward Rates" is accepted by** ***<font color="#AC2C1D">Insurance: Mathematics and Economics</font>*****!**
  + This paper can be found here: [[PDF](./publication/2024_IME_SW.pdf)] [[Journal](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.insmatheco.2023.11.003)]. 
  + We propose several methods for obtaining endogenous and positive ultimate forward rates for risk-free interest rate curves based on the Smith-Wilson method.
